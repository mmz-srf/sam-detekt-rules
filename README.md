# SAM Detekt Rules

## Documentation

You can find the documentation about how to write custom [rules here][custom_rule_documentation].

## Note

Remember that, by default, all rules are disabled. To configure your rules edit the file in
`src/main/resources/config/config.yml`.

Have a look at [jitpack], if you don't want to publish to maven central or the like.
